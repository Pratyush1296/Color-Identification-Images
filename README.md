# Color-Identification-Images
This repository has been created as part of my Data Science and Business Analytics Internship (GRIP) at the Sparks Foundation. 
The current task is to identify all colors from a given image. This task falls under the Computer Vision and IoT domain. The image used for testing has also been added in the repository. 

The list of colors (colors.csv) used in the code has been downloaded from the following link : https://github.com/codebrainz/color-names
